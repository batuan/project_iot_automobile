# Project_iot_automobile
In this project, I will create a datapipeline that processing data from IoT system.
There are 2 solutions in this project: 

 1. Google Cloud datapipeline
	* Pub/Sub, DataFlow, BigQuery, VM instances, Terraform
 2. Open-source data pipeline: 
	 * EMQX MQTT Broker, Apache Kafka, Apache NiFi, Spark, Apache Cassandra, Delta-lake

You can see the details of implementation of each datapipline in the sub-folder
You can watch the demo in this youtube [link](https://youtu.be/sFgFQwlCxmk?t=707):
